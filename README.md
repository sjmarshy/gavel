# Gavel

Brings order to your lists of things.

At the proof of concept stage at this point - you give it a list, say 'books', and an item, say 'The Shining' and it'll
ask you if it's better or worse than various other items in the list, eventually deciding on a position for it.

## Why?

Well, I've not done anything with it yet - but I wanted to start putting up lists of stuff on my website. Lists of books
I read, lists of quotes and principals and so on and so forth. When I've seen this [done before](https://sivers.org/book)
there's been a `/10` score. That's fine for when you don't know everything in the list, but if it's all stuff you know,
once you have several `10/10` items, which is better? The newest? The oldest? 

This way, everything is relative to everything else in the list. 


## So Far

so far, there's a very very simple cli application that can order lists of strings. It's really just a proof of concept
for the core algorithm. There's plenty besides that could be done with this.
